# User-Creation

Now that our domain is running, we’ll create OUs to keep things organized — like separating users by department. Then we’ll add some user accounts to simulate real employees. This makes it easier to manage permissions, apply policies, and scale the domain in future labs.

## We will create OUs and users:

### Users:
- Alex Johnson (admin)
- Mia Torres (IT)
- Michael Jordan(HR)

### Departments/ OUs:
- ADMINS
- IT
- Michael Jordan

To create an OU:
- Under Active Directory Users and Computers
- Left-click the domain, New, Organizational Unit
